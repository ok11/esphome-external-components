// Quick IntelliSense Test
// Open this file in VS Code and check:

#include "esphome/core/log.h"
#include "esphome/components/climate/climate_mode.h"

// 1. HOVER TEST: Hover your mouse over the #include lines above
//    Expected: Should show the actual file path, not an error
//    If you see the path, IntelliSense is finding the files ✓

// 2. GO TO DEFINITION TEST:
//    Right-click on "ClimateMode" below and select "Go to Definition" (or press F12)
using esphome::climate::ClimateMode;
//    Expected: Should jump to the ClimateMode definition
//    If it jumps to the definition, IntelliSense is working ✓

// 3. AUTOCOMPLETE TEST:
//    Type the following on a new line: esphome::climate::
//    Expected: Should show autocomplete suggestions for climate namespace
//    If you see suggestions, IntelliSense is working ✓

// If all three tests pass, your IntelliSense is working correctly!
